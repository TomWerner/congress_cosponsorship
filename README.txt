Congressional Cosponsorship Network Analysis

Currently implemented:
 - CDF plotting for senate and house of congresses 93-110
   plot_degree_distributions() calculates the adjacency matrix for each congress
   and then gets the distribution of the degrees for that congress and plots it in
   matplotlib.
